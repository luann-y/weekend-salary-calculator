Salary Calculator

## Description

For this project, I built a salary calculator to help manage employee compensation within a monthly budget. The main goal was to create a simple form in HTML to collect essential employee data and display it in a table. The table includes columns for employee first name, last name, ID, title, and annual salary, with a handy delete button for easy row removal.

After entering data and hitting the submit button, a JavaScript function captures the input details, updates the annual salary, and reflects the changes in the HTML. To calculate monthly salaries, I divided the annual salaries by 12 and calculated the total monthly salaries. The monthly budget is flagged in red if the cumulative salaries surpass the predefined budgetary limit of $20,000.

While working on this project, I spent around 5-9 hours refining my code, exploring different approaches to pass the script-tests. Despite some test errors, the code worked fine, highlighting the various ways coding challenges can be approached. I also learned to use the DOM inspect method to troubleshoot error messages and delved into new JavaScript functions and properties like parseFloat, parseInt, and textContent during my research when I ran into error messages or needed to figure out how to access a certain area within a table.

This project allowed me to apply my coding knowledge and offered opportunities for learning. It's a reminder that coding can be approached from different angles, and I used various resources, including past lectures, homework, and my own research, to successfully complete it. The end result is a user-friendly Salary Calculator that I hope will be useful.
